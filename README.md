# notebox
Simple Notepad app with Pages. The pagination is inspired by the *Note Pad* app on Macintosh 7.0. Supports previewing Markdown in HTML. Try it out at https://cycle622.github.io/notebox/

## Features [TODO]
+ Persistent - Data stays in the browser, and only in your browser
+ Export all your notes as one big JSON file, or as a singular `txt` file
+ Preview markdown as HTML (I use this to quickly format my emails)
+ Insert Timestamp using **F5** (Just like Windows 11's notepad)
+ Quickly rename your notes by pressing **F2** and quickly get back to your notes by pressing **Enter**
+ Quickly Go to a page by pressing **F1**
+ Navigate your pages by pressing **F3** and **F4**
